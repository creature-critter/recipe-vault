## hi
hiiiii this is a digitization of my recipe notebook!!! :3 this project is a part of the odin project curriculum, but this has been something i've been thinking about doing for a while now!

## erm ok, but why?
the current state of my recipe notebook is disastrous.... it's really hard to navigate as it doesn't have categories or designated sections. any changes i've made to recipes are either written on sticky notes or are chicken scratched into the margins of the page, and to be honest i can't even read what i've written down half the time lmao.

## 
the two goals of this project are to have fun and to organize my recipes :3

i'll have sections as follows...

- breads
- sides
- mains
- sauces
- desserts

no snacks because i really don't snack! 

as time goes on and i record more recipes, i might make adjustments to categories or include sub-categories as my little noggin sees fit!
