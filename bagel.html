    <h3>tools</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>small bowl</li>
        <li>large bowl</li>
        <li>kitchen scale</li>
        <li>pot - deep enough to cover bagels in water</li>
        <li>slotted spoon</li>
        <li>baking sheet</li>
        <li>parchment paper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>9 grams active dry yeast</li>
        <li>29 grams granulated sugar</li>
        <li>345 grams lukewarm water</li>
        <li>660 grams ap flour</li>
        <li>9 grams salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey for pre-baking boil</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <h4>knead & proof dough</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>in small bowl combine sugar, lukewarm water, and yeast. let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>in large bowl weigh out flour and salt.</li>
        <li>add wet to dry in large bowl. mix until flour is just absorbed.</li>
        <li>move dough from large bowl onto lightly floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>after kneading, move dough to lightly oiled large bowl and cover. cold proof in fridge overnight, or up to 14 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        
    <h4>shape dough</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>after cold proof, place dough on counter to warm up for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>once warm, cut dough at 155 grams. keep dough pieces covered. you should have about 7 pieces at this weight, but feel free to adjust to your liking.</li>
        <li>shape dough pieces into balls. keep dough balls covered.</li>
        <li>with the dough ball in your hand, pierce the center of the ball with your finger. stretch and shape the ball into a bagel shape. make the center of the bagle ~4 inches wide. the hole should be much larger than you expect, the dough will retract while it rests and once it's boiled!</li>
        <li>once all bagels are shaped, let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>boil & bake dough</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>while bagels are resting, set oven to preheat @ 425F</li>
        <li>fill pot with enough water to cover bagels, add the honey, cover pot, set water to boil.</li>
        <li>after resting, place bagels in boiling water for 1 minute, flip and boil for another minute on the other side. remove from water and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>once all bagels are boiled, place in oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>after baking options</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>eat all 7 bagels RIGHT away!</li>
        <li>keep covered on counter for 2-3 days.</li>
        <li>slice in half and freeze for the week, though they can last a few months frozen!
            <ul>
                <li>if sliced and frozen the bagels are easily reheated in a toaster!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
